**Simple Book API**
This repository contains a simple API simulating an online bookstore, designed to showcase my hands-on experience with API testing. As I continue to enhance my skills in software testing, this project serves as a practical tool for becoming familiar with API functionalities and testing methods.
The API includes several operations commonly found in an online bookstore, such as listing books, viewing details of a single book, placing orders, and managing those orders. This project provides practical exposure to the full lifecycle of API interactions, making it an essential part of my learning journey.

Key API Endpoints:
- API Status
Check the status of the API to ensure it’s functioning properly.

- List of Books
Retrieve a list of all available books in the store.

- Get Single Book
Fetch details of a specific book using its unique identifier.

- Order Book
Place an order for a selected book.

- Get All Orders
Retrieve all orders placed on the platform.

- Get an Order
View the details of a specific order by its order ID.

- Update an Order
Modify the details of an existing order.

- Delete an Order
Cancel and remove an order from the system.


**My API Testing Journey**
This project is part of my self-driven initiative to expand my expertise in API testing. While I’m still in the process of building hands-on experience, this project has allowed me to explore API requests, understand various HTTP methods, and practice automation testing concepts. Through this work, I’ve gained exposure to:

- API Testing Methodologies: Understanding the differences between REST, SOAP, and other protocols.
- HTTP Methods: Working with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.
- Request Validation: Ensuring the accuracy of API responses, status codes, and data formatting.
- Automation Tools: Using tools like Postman and learning how to set up and execute tests.
- Error Handling & Debugging: Identifying issues in API responses and troubleshooting them.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- Postman for manual API testing.
- JSON for data interchange format.
- Node.js (or another backend technology) to build the API.
- Git for version control.


**How to Run the Project:**
